- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] __PROJECT_NAME__ Vulnerability Report`

### 3. Include Detailed Information

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish by exploiting this vulnerability?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Operating system, __PROJECT_NAME__ version, Go version
- **Supporting Material**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code (if applicable)

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates throughout the investigation
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### 5. Coordinated Disclosure

1. We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will coordinate the public disclosure timeline with you
4. We will credit you in our security advisory (if desired)

## Security Features

### Supply Chain Security
- All releases are signed with Cosign
- Published with SHA256 checksums for verification
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) attached to every release
- Dependencies monitored via `govulncheck` in CI

### Verification

```bash
# Verify checksums
sha256sum -c checksums.txt

# Verify the keyless Cosign signature: the certificate names the workflow that signed
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate checksums.txt.pem --signature checksums.txt.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/__ORG__/__PROJECT_NAME__/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  checksums.txt
```

## Dependencies

We actively monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities:
- Automated `govulncheck` scanning in CI
- Regular dependency updates
- Prompt response to vulnerability disclosures
